        <p>
            Your task is to extend the password manager application from the lab part. There will be added support for saving the encrypted user data, storing images and extending the password editor and directory tree. This is a second part of WPF Task for 12 points. In case of any doubts concerning the task, please inspect the sample application or consult your teacher.
